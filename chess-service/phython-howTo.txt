if you have a problem with your virtual server: do the following:
1. cd /path/to/your/project/chess-service
2. rm -rf venv
3. python3 -m venv venv
4. source venv/bin/activate
5. pip install -r requirements.txt
6. check if port is 5000 and if in use kill it: 
   1. lsof -i :5000
   2. kill -9 <PID> (Replace <PID> with the actual process ID you found from the previous step.)
7. flask run

When Visiual Studido restarts
==================
1. for python:
    * open terminal for "chess-service" folder
    * run: source venv/bin/activate
    * the run: run flask
2. For react:
    * open "chess-app" folder
    * npm run

    
Python debug tools:
======================================
1. print():

The simplest way to display variable values for debugging.
python:
my_var = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print(my_var)
pprint (Pretty Print):

2. This is useful for printing complex nested data structures like lists and dictionaries in a more readable way.
python
import pprint

* my_var = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "address": {"city": "New York", "zip": "10001"}}
pprint.pprint(my_var)
repr():

* Returns a string representation of the object, helpful for debugging when you want to see the raw format.
python
my_var = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print(repr(my_var))
dir():

* Lists all the attributes and methods of an object, useful for introspection.
python
my_var = [1, 2, 3]
print(dir(my_var))
vars():

* Returns the __dict__ attribute for an object, i.e., the object's attributes and their values as a dictionary.
python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

obj = MyClass("John", 30)
print(vars(obj))
type():

Shows the type of a variable, useful to check what kind of data you're dealing with.
python
Copy code
my_var = [1, 2, 3]
print(type(my_var))
logging module:

For more advanced debugging, you can use the logging module to track and log variable states.
python
Copy code
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
my_var = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
logging.debug(f'My var: {my_var}')
breakpoint() / pdb:

You can use Python's built-in debugger (pdb) to pause execution and inspect variables interactively.
python
Copy code
my_var = {"name": "John", "age": 30}
breakpoint()  # Pauses execution here and opens an interactive debugger
print(my_var)


Common pdb Commands:
======================================
p variable_name: Print the value of a variable.

Example: p x will print the value of the variable x.
n (next): Move to the next line of code within the current function.

This will execute the current line and stop at the next one.
s (step): Step into the function call.

If the current line contains a function call, s will move into that function.
c (continue): Continue running the program until the next breakpoint or the end of the program.

This will stop the debugger and resume normal execution.
q (quit): Exit the debugger and stop the program.

l (list): Show the current location in the source code and a few surrounding lines.

h (help): Display help on commands, or provide help for a specific command.

Example: h n will show help for the n command.
